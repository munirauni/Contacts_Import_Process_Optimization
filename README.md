# CONTACTS IMPORT PROCESS OPTIMIZATION

## TOOLS: 
Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, Google Contacts, WhatsApp

## ISSUE:

I'm working in sales department of a business training and consultation company where we organize seminars on monthly basis. Prior to each event, every sales team receives around 300 - 400 contacts per event from marketing team consist of seminar participants which we need to message and follow up. 

Unfortunately, there was no system where we can save contacts to phone in bulk within a short time. We need to save contacts manually to phone by referring to the list of contacts given where it could take around 2 days. This method was very inefficient and took time where the sales team had been using this method for a long time. This was where I came to realised that i had to do something to improve the process.


## SOLUTION:

I developed a new method to import contacts by integrating spreadsheet, Google Contacts, and WhatsApp where it is efficient as this method only takes around 30 minutes instead of 2 days. Then, I trained all team members within sales department to execute the same method. It gave huge impact to us where this has become our main procedure to manage contacts.

2. Data cleaning has to be done. The table is transformed by creating unique codes and merging them to each rows of Full Name column then unwanted columns are removed. Prepare a csv file consisting of table which is customized to be used to import into Google Contacts and transfer all the cleaned data to the csv file.
